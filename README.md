## Description
Given starter code, we are presented with an application that enables the "payroll manager" to view and manage employee payroll information. When opening the page, at first glance, the buttons do not work and when console logging, we get an error. We were tasked with being able to add prompts so that the user is able to add emmployee information, be able to store it once "cancelled" or done, that it displays employee information on the page, and that a random employee could be generated as well as a median of all incomes.
